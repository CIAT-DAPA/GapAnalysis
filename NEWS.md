# GapAnalysis 2.0.0

* Initial CRAN submission.

Fundamentally the gap analysis functions will produce the same quantitative results as the first version of the package

Specific changes 

- Workflows use `sf` and `terra` libraries 

- Individuals functions produce leaflet maps to visualize outputs 

- removed the `summaryHTML` function for the intial release. This should be added again in later updates.
