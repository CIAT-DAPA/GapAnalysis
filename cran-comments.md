* This is a new release.

Thank you for your efforts :) 

The previous version of this package utilized the `sp` and `raster` libraries. 

This update is primary to transition all spatial data workflows to the currently supported libraries of `terra` and `sf`

As it's a major update we've also taken the time to add some quality of life projects to the primary functions to give end users more evaluatory outputs, i.e. maps.
