*This is a version update of an existing library 


The previous version of this package utilized the `sp` and `raster` libraries. 

This update is primary to transition all spatial data workflows to the currently supported libraries of `terra` and `sf`

As it's a major update we've also taken the time to add some quality of life projects to the primary functions to give end users more evaluatory outputs, i.e. maps.
